\section{Introduction}

This report describes the modeling and implementation of the Ready-Mixed Concrete (RMC) problem exercise using Gecode.

\section{Instance Specification and Preprocessing}

The problem instances are described using XML files. They contain lists of orders, vehicles and stations. The output
nodes in the XML files are ignored.

The provided data files contain many entries that are invalid, as well as problems that are not satisfiable. Vehicles
that have neither a normal volume nor a maximum volume set are ignored, as well as stations without names. For each
order at least one vehicle must exist which can fulfill this order, otherwise the problem does not have a solution. 

In order to limit the model to integer variables, volumes of concrete are converted into integer units of $\dm$. Time
spans such as the time to load vehicles are represented in minutes, while points in time such as the start time of an
order are represented in minutes since the earliest time stamp in the problem specification. 
Discharge rates of the vehicles are expressed as integer values in $\dm$ per minutes.

While multiple orders for the same construction yard may exist but since travel
times are specified per order, not per yard, the problem was slightly simplified by assuming every order is for a
different construction yard, making construction yards and orders equivalent.
In the following, we thus only consider orders. If multiple orders for the same construction yard may exist, the 
constraint that allows only one vehicle to be unloaded per order must be modified to allow only one vehicle to be
unloaded per yard, by using the yard identifier instead of the order identifier to check for overlaps.

The travel times between stations and orders are converted from a variable length list per order to a single dense
matrix $\OtravelTo$ containing the 
travel times from stations to orders and to a matrix $\OtravelFrom$ containing the travel times from orders to yards.
If no value for a pair of order and station is given in the problem specification, it is assumed that it is not possible
to travel that route and the corresponding entries in the matrices are set to a very large value to avoid solutions that
contain such a route.

The amount of concrete that a vehicle can deliver may depend on the order. The volumes of all vehicles are precalculated
and stored in a matrix $\Vvolume$ indexed by order and vehicle.

\medskip
In addition to the provided data files, a small example with just two orders, three vehicles and three stations was
created to test and experiment with the model.

\section{Representation of Deliveries}

The expected output of the RMC problem is a schedule for all vehicles which order has to be fulfilled from which
station at which point in time. There are at least three ways to represent this schedule. 

\begin{itemize}
\item A single list of deliveries
 might contain a vehicle index, a station index and an order index per delivery.

\item A list of deliveries for each order defines which vehicles serve this order.

\item A list of deliveries for each vehicle defines which orders are served by this vehicle.
\end{itemize}

The issue with all three representations is that the number of deliveries is not fixed, and it is not possible to have
the size of the delivery lists depend on decision variables.\footnote{It might be possible to store deliveries using
sets, but this has not been explored for this model.}
Instead, an upper bound on the number of deliveries is calculated, and an array of boolean variables defines per
delivery if it is used or not.

Since the first option uses only one single list, a tighter bound on the length of the list and thus on the number of
variables might be found. However, the other ways of modeling the problem simplify some ordering constraints, therefore
the first option was not further explored.

For this exercise a lists of deliveries for each vehicle were used. The advantage over lists per order is that it is
simpler to determine the travel times between stations and yards per vehicle, as the next trip of a vehicle can
be easily determined. The disadvantage is that the lag time between deliveries for a given order is much more difficult
to determine, but it was assumed that this is slightly less of an issue than determining the travel times for vehicles.
